Welcome to My Mobapp Studio

#Task

The task is to first implement this functions for the dataset called googleplaystore.csv

load_dataset() print_summarize_dataset(dataset) clean_dataset(dataset) print_histograms(dataset) compute_correlations_matrix(dataset) print_scatter_matrix()

After implementing the function , the second part will be to write a report and publish on any blog platform of our choice. To drive our Analysis: we need to do the following

Plot with bar diagram the most populars paid apps of Family category

Plot with a pie diagram the most popular genres according to the number of installations from paid family

An array with the number of installation per category

Plot a pie with the number of installation per category

Plot a bar with the mean price per category

Most expensive apps per category

#Description

The load_dataset function loads the dataset from the CSV file using Pandas.

The clean_dataset function removes duplicates, missing values, and formats columns like "Installs", "Price", and "Reviews"

The print_histograms function generates histograms for specified columns using Matplotlib.

The print_scatter_matrix function creates a scatter matrix for specified columns.

The compute_correlations_matrix functions creates a correlation for the dataset.

The second part that shows the blog-post report is also present in the script.

#Installation

There was no major installation but we used pandas, matplotlib, numpy for our analysis.

We also used "medium  and word doc" for our blog-post.

#Usage

To use this code, The CSV file named "googleplaystore.csv" is in the same directory as the script.

When you run the script, it will load the data from the CSV file into a DataFrame and display it on the console.
